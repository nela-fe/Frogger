## <a name="installing"/>Installing the game

Download all files and save them into a folder on your computer.
Open "index.html" in your browser.

## <a name="playing"/>Playing the game

You are the little person standing on the grass at the bottom end of the playing field.

Try to reach the water at the top.

Use the arrow keys for controlling the player.

Don't step on the bugs. When you run into a bug, the player is reset to the grass and you lose a life (heart).

When you reach the water, you gain a star.

When you have lost all hearts, you lose the game.

When you have 5 stars, you win the game.




## These were the original Instructions:

Use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/15/view) for self-checking your submission.

Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like `Player` and `Enemy`) or class prototype functions such as `Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions`. Also make sure that the keyword `this` is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon.

Your **README.md** file should be updated with instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).
